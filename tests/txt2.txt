Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries by automating tasks and enabling intelligent decision-making.
Machine learning, a subset of AI, allows systems to learn from data and improve over time without explicit programming.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) empowers AI to understand and generate human language, revolutionizing fields like customer service and content creation.
As AI continues to evolve, its applications will expand across healthcare, finance, and other critical sectors.
